This is a twitter post bot that takes in a description and gives out 1 or multiple posts that you can copy and paste on twitter with hashtags. 
To make this code work, first write the following in your terminal. (I am assuming you have already installed npm and other stuff required)
```npx create-next-app twitter-post```
this will create a folder like that. 
then you just need to add the above code in the components folder inside the app directory. if there's no components folder, create one. 

now, to install the dependencies, run the following commands: 
```npm install @google/generative-ai ```
```npm install react-icons```
and then you need to run the following command: 
```npm run dev```
click on the links it presents you with and there you have your app.
